### 💻 My Major Weapon: iOS Development

With over 5 years of hands-on experience in iOS development, I specialize in building scalable, user-centric apps using:

- 🚀 **Swift & SwiftUI**
- 🧱 **UIKit, Combine, Core Data**
- 🧠 **ARKit, MLKit, AVFoundation**
- 🧪 **Unit & UI Testing, Clean Architecture**
- 📦 **App Store / TestFlight Deployment**

I’ve led the development of impactful apps ranging from **assistive technology for the visually impaired** to **content creation and keyboard utilities**, shaping experiences for thousands of users.

### 🔧 Learning: Backend Development

To become a **well-rounded product engineer**, I’ve been diving into the backend world with:

- ☕️ **Java 17**
- 🌱 **Spring Boot**
- 🧩 **Microservices Architecture**
- 📡 **RESTful APIs**
- 🐳 **Docker, AWS (ECS, RDS)**

I’m currently building Java-based microservices and learning how to deploy production-ready backends.
